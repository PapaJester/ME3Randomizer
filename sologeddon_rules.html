					<center><b><u><br><br>SOLOGEDDON RULES:</b></u></center><br><br>

    SoloGeddon is meant for 2 or more participants. Players compete similtaneously, trying to complete a solo on the same map and difficulty against the same enemy. Each player is randomly assigned a Character and a Weapon Type. Any weapon of that type may be chosen by the player, but only ONE weapon may be carried. Map and enemy should also be randomly determined, but for all players in that Round. Difficulty should be mutally agreed upon by all players before starting.
    The players' goal is to complete the assigned solo with the best time for that round. If a player dies, other players in the round need only progress to a later Wave in order to claim victory for that round.
    All game mods are allowed, as long as all players agree, and are all using the same mods.<br><br><b><i>Disconnects:</b></i> 
	If a Player is disconnected from the Mass Effect 3 servers during the course of their match, they are permitted to replay the match from the beginning at a later time. 
	The other Player(s) should finish their solos as normal. During the replay of the interrupted solo, the Player is limited to the <i><u>exact</u></i> Character, Weapon, 
	Weapon Mods, Equipment, and Gear that they began the interrupted solo with.<br><br>

<center><b><u>CURRENT VARIATIONS (allowed with unanimous consent from all participants):</b></u></center><br><br>
	<b><i>- Wild Cards:</b></i> A Wild Card is a modifier that applies to all Players in a round, sometimes changing the Character or Weapon restrictions for the Players. They are built into the SoloGeddon Randomizer, but if all Players decide not to use this variant, they may be ignored.<br><br>
	<b><i>- No Talon Mercenary:</b></i> Due to the problems the character has with keybindings, it's permitted to exclude the Talon Engineer from the possible list of characters. If players are using a randomizer that has assigned the Talon Engineer to a player, this results in a re-roll. The SoloGeddon randomizer defaults to excluding the Talon Mercenary.<br><br>
	<b><i>- No Repeats (Maps and/or Enemies):</b></i> If the means by which the players are randomly determining the Round's paramiters assigns the same map and/or enemy and the Round immediately preceeding it, this results in a re-roll. Note that what this condition applys to (just Map, just Enemy, or either one) must be agreed upon by all participants before the session begins.<br><br>
	<b><i>- No Repeats (Characters):</b></i> If the means by which the players are randomly assigned a Character results in a player being assigned the same character they played in the Round immediately preceeding it, that player will be assigned another Character/Weapon Type. If players are using the ME3 Randomizer, they may simply use the combo assigned in the next slot (Player 2 takes the kit assigned to Player 3, for example).<br><br>
	<b><i>- Galaxy Tour:</b></i> Instead of randomizing the Maps, players can decide to go on the Galaxy Tour, where they will play one Round on each of the Maps available. The order of the Maps will be the order in which they appear in the game's list of Maps (Dagger, Ghost, Giant, etc.). NO MAPS CAN BE SKIPPED/MODDED OUT in this variant. Enemies and Character/Weapon Type combos are still determined randomly.<br><br>
	<b><i>- Mirror Match:</b></i> Only one Character/Weapon Type combo is generated, and all participants are limited to that, though they may choose different weapons within that Weapon Type.<br><br>
